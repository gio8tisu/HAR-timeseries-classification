## Data

HAR motion-sense dataset hosted on [https://www.kaggle.com/malekzadeh/motionsense-dataset](kaggle)

This dataset includes time-series data generated by accelerometer and gyroscope
sensors (attitude, gravity, userAcceleration, and rotationRate). It is collected
with an iPhone 6s kept in the participantâ€™s front pocket using SensingKit which
collects information from Core Motion framework on iOS devices. A total of 24
participants in a range of gender, age, weight, and height performed 6 activities in
15 trials in the same environment and conditions: downstairs, upstairs, walking,
jogging, sitting, and standing. With this dataset, we aim to look for personal
attributes fingerprints in time-series of sensor data, i.e. attribute-specific patterns
that can be used to infer gender or personality of the data subjects in addition
to their activities.

### Analysis

* Correlations
* Metadata (classes, gender, age, ...)
* Fourier transform
* Wavelet transform

## Feature extraction

* Fourier transform
* Wavelet transform
* Dynamic time warping
* Global alignment kernel (SVM)

### Feature selection

??

## Classification

### Baseline

Feature extraction methods will be compared using this classification method.

Possible candidates are naive bayes, logistic regresion, ...

### Advanced methods

SVM, kNN, classification trees, MLP, ...

### Ensemble methods

Classification rule based on best classificators.

Boosting algorithms (XGBoost, LightGBM, ...).

### Neural networks

CNNs or RNNs for classification without feature extraction.
